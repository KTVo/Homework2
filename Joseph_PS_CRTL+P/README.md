Disregard the inaccurate file descriptions. The only modifications that must be made are within the cps(for the ps command) and procdump(for the CTRL + p command) functions in the proc.c file. The outputs for B (elapsed time) and C (UID, GID, PPID) are all that still have to be added to these functions for part D.
